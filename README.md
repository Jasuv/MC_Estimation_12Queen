Uses the Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the number of nodes in the 12-Queens problem

ex. (n = 12, #OfSteps = 100)
step: 10 --- numnodes = 8774077
step: 20 --- numnodes = 10733629
step: 30 --- numnodes = 1870285
step: 40 --- numnodes = 10488685
step: 50 --- numnodes = 5467981
step: 60 --- numnodes = 8126077
step: 70 --- numnodes = 13212877
step: 80 --- numnodes = 7132045
step: 90 --- numnodes = 16067965
step: 100 --- numnodes = 5499085
total nodes = 1025756068
avg = 10257560
